1. Write a program for computing GCD of 2 numbers with optimal data structures and less time-consuming.

    The program should take input from console or args and should handle unexpected inputs    

    Constraints:

        - For loop is not allowed

        - input should be in words:

            - e.g.: onetwo = 12, sixone = 61

        - words will be within zero to nine

        - Cannot use inbuilt methods like max, min, or any math function    

    Example 1:

        - Input 1: onezero

        - Input 2: twozero

        - Output: onezero

    Example 2:

        - Input 1: twosix

        - Input 2: twofour

        - Output: two



2. Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

    Constraints:

        - 1 <= n <= 8

    Example 1:

        - Input: n = 3

        - Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

        - Example 2:

    Example 2:

        - Input: n = 1

        - Output: ["()"] 



3. Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

    An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

    Constraints:

        - 1 <= strs.length <= 104

        - 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100

        - strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

    Example 1:

        - Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

        - Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

    Example 2:

        - Input: strs = [""]

        - Output: [[""]]

    Example 3:

        - Input: strs = ["a"]

        - Output: [["a"]]
